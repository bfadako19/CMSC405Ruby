# Ruby provides a whole set of I/O mehtods in the Kernel module
# A Ruby module is like a Java interface 

# The print mehtod prints each parameter its passed to standard out (stdout)
# It does not append a new line to the end of its output
print "cat", [1,2,3], 99, "\n"
print "cat", [1,2,3], 99, "\n"

# Observations: The arguments to the print method were not enclosed in parenthesis
# Delimiters like the semi-colon, weren't needed at the end of the lines of code
